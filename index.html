        The Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean, plunges to about 36,000 feet (nearly 11,000 meters) below
        sea level. That’s deeper than Mount Everest's height, which stands at 29,032 feet (8,849 meters). If Mount
        Everest
        were placed inside the trench, there would still be over 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) of water above it. The trench
        is
        located in the western Pacific Ocean and was first explored in 1960 by the bathyscaphe Trieste, reaching its
        deepest
        known point, Challenger Deep.

        alt="most likely a picture of an underground ocean maybe" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
      <p>Scientists have discovered what appears to be a vast underground ocean trapped between layers of rock
        about 400 miles (640 kilometers) below the Earth's surface. This hidden reservoir is thought to contain more
        water than all the oceans on the surface combined. The water is stored in a mineral called ringwoodite, which
        acts like a sponge, holding the water under immense pressure. This discovery suggests that Earth's water cycle
        extends far deeper than previously believed.</p>

      <h2>Oceans Hold Around 97% of Earth’s Water</h2>
    </div>
    <!--Fact text and image-->

        alt="most likely a picture of Earth in map from" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
      <p>
        While many people associate Earth's water supply with freshwater lakes and rivers, the vast majority of the
        planet’s
        water—around 97%—is actually contained in the oceans. These immense bodies of saltwater serve as Earth's largest
        reservoir, playing a crucial role in climate regulation, weather patterns, and supporting marine life. The
        remaining
        3% of Earth's water is mostly locked in glaciers and ice caps, with only a tiny fraction available as freshwater
        for
        human consumption.

        alt="Picture of a cute ghost fish thing" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
      <p> In the deepest and darkest parts of the ocean, scientists have discovered fascinating life forms that seem
        almost
        invisible. These creatures, often called "ghost fish," lack pigmentation, making them appear translucent. They
        have
        evolved to survive extreme pressure and total darkness, relying on slow metabolisms and highly sensitive sensory
        organs.
        Some species use bioluminescence to communicate or attract prey, while others have developed elongated bodies to
        move
        efficiently in the deep. The deep sea remains one of Earth's most mysterious and least explored environments.

      <h2>Oceans Produce Half of the World’s Oxygen</h2>

        alt="A human breathing fresh air" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
      <p>
        Oceans, particularly through the activity of microscopic organisms called phytoplankton, generate over 50% of
        the
        Earth’s oxygen. These tiny plants float near the ocean’s surface and use sunlight to photosynthesize, releasing
        oxygen as a byproduct. This process, known as oceanic photosynthesis, is essential for maintaining Earth's
        atmosphere
        and supporting marine ecosystems. Without phytoplankton, oxygen levels in the air would drop significantly,
        affecting
        all life on the planet.
